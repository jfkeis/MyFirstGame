Basic Helicopter Game

Created basic helicopter Android Game.  Added smoke puff functionality, as well as randomly generated missiles that increase in speed the further the player advances.  The player helicopter and missiles are animated and refresh each frame.  The game is capped at 30 frames per second. In the future the game can be expanded to add borders and a restart screen, as well as logging score.
